The principles of the Humminbird architecture;
<ol>
<li>Keep it Simple. Complexity is a huge cost factor in not only the development, but also the deployment, usage and maintenance of a system. Any idiot can write thousands and thousands of line of code. We expect you to be smart and write only the code that is needed. Nothing more, nothing less. Always remember that the main goal of Hummingbird is to create a system that is simple to deploy, simple to use and simple to extend. Count if source code lines is the main metric here, but also the number of configuration steps / values that needs to be set.</li>
<li>Think Agile. Follow the Agile principles; do what you know is needed, think full functionalities not isolated blocks, only create abstractions when abstractions are needed, refactor often.</li>
<li>Ensure scalablility. A core concept of the system is that any performance can be reached, simply by deploying more instances of the system components in parallel in a distributed environment. This means that no central singleton service should be forced upon the system, such as a centralized login service. Always decentralize as much as possible.</li>
<li>Use Convention over configuration. Typically 90% of the use cases are covered by default settings. Always provide reasonable default settings. Also dont confuse the user with long tables of configuration variables; state clearly in the documentation which conventions are expected to be held, then base your source code on them.</li>
<li>Integrate into Hummingbird. Hummingbird is based on a set of standard COTS. Use these unless there is a very, very good reason not to. Push as much functionality to these COTS as possible. Else the dependencies on COTS will explode.</li>
<li>Use existing solutions. If you need something, somebody surely already invented it. Go find it. Then integrate it.</li>
</ol>
