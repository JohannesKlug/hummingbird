/**

 * 
 * A request is defined through;
 * - Initial position. The stating position for the prediction. Will default to the current position.
 * - Initial velocity. The starting velocity. Will default to the current velocity. 
 * - start time. The starting time. Defaults to the current time.
 * - delta propagation. The delta time that the prediction should propagate from the start time. 
 * - Locations. Locations whose coverage should also be covered as part of the prediction.
