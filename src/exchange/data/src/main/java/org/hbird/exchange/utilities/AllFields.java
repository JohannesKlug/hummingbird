/** Maps all POJO fields to JMS header fields, leaving the POJO unchanged. If
 * you only want specific fields, consider using the 'SelectedFields' mapper.
 *
 * This class can be added to a camel route, to map the fields of a POJO to
 * JMS message header fields. The JMS message, containing the POJO in its 
 * body, will thereafter also list all POJO fields in its header. The mapper
 * will take public, protected as well as private fields, from this class as
 * well as all super classes.
 * 
 * This is useful for filtering in for example routes using ActiveMQ, where only
 * the header fields can be used for filtering / routing.
 *  
 * NOTE: This class is strictly not needed. The same effect can be gained by
 * using Camel scripting the the route, for example 
 * 
 * <route>
 *   <...>
 *   <setHeader name="Name">
 *     <simple>${body.getName}</simple>
 *   </setHeader>
 *   <...>
 * </route>
 *  
 * Which will create a header field 'Name' set to the value of the body objects
 * return of 'getName'. Mapping many fields in many different routes can however 
 * seriously over complicate the route definitions and lead to a bloat of XML.
 * In addition the header fields of any new types of data transfered in a route
 * will have to be reflected in all script based mappings as well. 
 *   
 * Using a single instance of this class, reused in different routes, may thus
 * be a better alternative
 *
 * <bean id="mapper" class="org.hbird.exchange.utils.AllFields"/>
 * 
 * <route id="Route1">
 *   <...>
 *   <to uri="bean:mapper"/>
 *   <...>
 * </route>
 *
 * <route id="Route2">
 *   <...>
 *   <to uri="bean:mapper"/>
 *   <...>
