/**
 * The executor performs the tasks scheduled for a task. A task may have an
 * execution time delay set, i.e. a latency period before it should be executed.
 * This delay must be applied prior to this class being invoked, i.e. this class
 * does not apply the task execution delay constrain, it simply execute the task
 * 
 * The tasks should be read for example from an activemq queue dedicated for scheduled 
 * tasks. Multiple task executers may run in parallel, each processing separate tasks.
