We, the Hummingbird team, consider work to be done when the following criteria are met:

 * Code is well documented 
 * All your tests pass, no existing tests are broken
 * All your tests are correctly stubbed and do not require access to network locations or local files outside the test resources directory
 * Your code compiles and runs alongside all the existing Hummingbird code, thus is well integrated 
 * Hudson must accept your build, no failing tests anywhere, no exceptions
 * Sonar finds no "Blockers" or critical violations
 
If any of these criteria are not met, your work is not considered done by the rest of the team. Go back, and fix all remaining issues.
