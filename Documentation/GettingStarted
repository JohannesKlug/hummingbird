h1. Getting Started with Hummingbird development

h2. Mailing lists

As a first step, you might want to join our mailinglists. If you are a current or prospective user, subscribe to the "users" list. If youâ€™d like to join the development team, subscribe to the "developers" list:

http://groups.google.com/group/hummingbird-users

http://groups.google.com/group/hummingbird-dev

You don't have to sign up with Google Groups. If you prefer not to, just send an email to hummingbird-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com or hummingbird-dev+subscribe@googlegroups.com, respectively.

h2. Project structure

The Hummingbird core system is contained within the _hummingbird_ repository. All of telemetry processing, archiving, commanding go in there. This repository is hosted publicly at Github. See the next section on how to get the source code.

For the graphical user interface, two additional repositories are maintained, both hosted on a server run by Logica. If you are interested in testing or improving the user interface, drop an email to either of the mailing lists. Some at Logica can grant you access to the repositories in question.

h2. Check out the source code

Source code is hosted on "Github":http://github.com/JohannesKlug/hummingbird

You need to install git, create an account at github and submit your public key. Comprehensive documentation is available on "Github":http://help.github.com/.

After signing up, you can check out the code by using this git URL: git@github.com:JohannesKlug/hummingbird.git

On the command line, that would be accomplished using "git clone _url_".

h3. Getting the source code from within the Logica corporate network

Those of you operating within the Logica network normally can't access Github using ssh directly. There are two possibilities here:
 * Tunneling ssh through a host on the Logica DMZ (see this description on the "internal wiki":http://10.48.29.100/wiki/index.php5/Git#Setting_up_remote_git_access.
 * Using Logica's own git repository on open.logicaspace.com. Email Johannes.Klug@logica.com or Mark.Doyle@logica.com to grant you access. Attach your public key to that email!
 
h2. Building Hummingbird

The Hummingbird Core is defined as a Maven project, so you will need Maven to build the software conveniently. On the command line, you can do so with _mvn install_ or _mvn.bat install_ on Windows.

For usage in Eclipse, see the next section.

h3. (Optional) Importing Hummingbird into Eclipse

If you haven't got it installed yet, get yourself the "m2eclipse" plugin for Eclipse, see "m2eclipse Website":http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/. m2eclipse requires you to use a full JDK (as opposed to a JRE) distribution of Java. If you are running a JRE, m2eclipse will notify you about this and you need to install a proper JDK and point Eclipse to it.

Now the Import Projects tool will let you locate Hummingbird ("Existing Maven project"). Choose the "hummingbird" sub-directory, so that all the sub-modules are selected as well. After that, you can trigger a full build with a right-click on the root project ("hummingbird"), and selecting "Run As" -> "Maven Install".
